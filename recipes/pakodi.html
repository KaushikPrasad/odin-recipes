        <li>Add water gradually and mix the batter well to get a smooth and thick consistency. The batter should not be too thin or too thick.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables or other ingredients of your choice to the batter and mix well so that they are coated evenly with the batter.</li>

        <li>Once the pakodis are done, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the pakodis hot with your favorite chutney or ketchup.</li>
